### Hi, I'm Jelani Alexis.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my portfolio website to have my dev portfolio AND my music portfolio on it. I will also be linking it to a backend.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.js 13.
- ðŸ“« You can find my portfolio at [my website here](https://jelanialexis.netlify.app).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I taught myself how to use Discord.js only for me to never use it for anything significant
